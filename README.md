# myERC20Token
This repo contains the source code of the ERC20 token I've developed while learning programming on the Ethereum blockchain.

I've written 2 posts containing an explanation of the basic concepts around the Etherum blockchain and an analysis of the source code of my ERC20 token.
The token inherits all the functionalities from OpenZeppelin (https://openzeppelin.com/) library, so in the article I've analyzed the source code of the library.

The 2 posts can be found on my Medium:
